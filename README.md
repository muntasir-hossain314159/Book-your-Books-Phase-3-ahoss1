# Book-your-Books-Phase-3-ahoss1

"Book your Books" is a website that is being developed for students at the University of New Haven. Students will upload their used course books on the platform and current students who are enrolled in that particular course would be able to buy them. The website serves as a Client to Client communication platform where the buyer's information would be transferred to the seller, who would then communicate with the buyer directly. <br>

In Phase - 2, I completed the design of the Home, Search, Sign In, Sign Up, and User Profile Page. Additionally, I integrated MongoDB as the database to store User and Course Book Information. The user is able to sign up and authenticate themselves using their email and password. Consequently, the user is able to log out from the platform. In their User Profile Page, the user is able to upload books onto the website with all the relevant information (Book Name, Cost, Course Number, Course Name, Instructor, and Image). The Image, Book Name, and Cost provided by the user is added to the Recently Added section in the Home Page. Moreover, I integrated Bootstrap and created a responsive website for all screen sizes. During development, I followed the Model-View-Container (MVC) software design pattern.
