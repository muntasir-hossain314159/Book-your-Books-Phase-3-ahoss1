# Book-your-Books-Phase-3-ahoss1

"Book your Books" is a website that is being developed for students at the University of New Haven. Students will upload their used course books on the platform and current students who are enrolled in that particular course would be able to buy them. The website serves as a Client to Client communication platform where the buyer's information would be transferred to the seller, who would then communicate with the buyer directly. <br>

In Phase - 3, I completed "My Purchases", "My Sellings", "Book Bag" and "Search" sections. I integrated JQuery for API requests. Moreover, I implemented case insenstive search operations using regex to allow more flexibility during searches. <br>

Details of Purchasing a Book:
1. The Buyer is able to submit a bid for their book
2. The contact information of the Buyer would then be available under Interested Buyers in the Seller's dashboard (My Sellings -> Sellings -> Particular Course Book -> Show)
3. The Seller would then contact the Buyer and then decide on a particular Buyer by approving them
4. The Seller may decide to reject a buyer
5. Once the Seller approves the Buyer, the book is moved the "Sold" section in the Seller's dashboard 
6. The book would then move in the My Purchases section from Current Bids to Purchased
7. Provided the Seller rejects the Buyer, the book would move to the Rejected Bids Section from Current Bids

During development, I followed the Model-View-Container (MVC) software design pattern.
